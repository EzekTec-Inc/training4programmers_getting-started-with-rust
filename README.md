# Getting Started with Rust Webinar

Welcome to the Rust for Python Programmers webinar! This webinar aims to help you learn some of the basics of the Rust programming language.

## Getting Started

We encourage you to fork this repository into your own GitHub account for this online webinar. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page.

Whether you fork or not, you have two options for coding along with the presenter:

1. **Codespaces**: You can use GitHub Codespaces to run the code directly in your browser. Using Codespaces is the easiest way to get started with the webinar. Click the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces" to start a new Codespace with the webinar materials. While GitHub provides a free tier for Codespaces (120 hours per month), you may need to upgrade to a paid plan if you exceed the usage limits. You can find more information about Codespaces in the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).

2. **Local Setup**: If you prefer to run the code on your machine, you can clone the repository and set up your local environment. You must have Rust installed on your machine to run the code.
  - You can install Rust by following the instructions on the [official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

**IMPORTANT:** Because of the limited time for the webinar, if you run into setup problems, providing individual support will not be possible. We recommend using Codespaces if you have trouble setting up your local environment. If you cannot set up a working development environment, watch the webinar, and you can follow along with the webinar recording later.
