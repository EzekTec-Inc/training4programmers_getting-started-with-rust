# Getting Started with Rust
## Compiler Directives

```rust
#![allow(unused_variables)]
```
This line tells the Rust compiler to not issue a warning for any variables that are declared but not used in your code. By default, Rust will issue warnings for unused variables as they could indicate a mistake in the code. However, there might be cases where you're prototyping or testing something and you don't want these warnings to clutter your output.

```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]
```
This line tells the Rust compiler to not issue a warning for any function or method that is defined but never called, also known as "dead code". Similar to the previous directive, this can be useful when you're in the middle of developing a program and have functions that aren't being used yet.

These directives are typically used during development to suppress warnings for code that is work in progress. However, it's generally a good idea to remove them for production code to take full advantage of Rust's warning system.
